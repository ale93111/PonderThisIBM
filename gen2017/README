Solved this month challenge using arbitrary precision numbers. 
It's possible to find a quick solution in Python with a simple script, thanks to Python's arbitrary precision integers.
To find a better solution and earn myself a '*' i decided to use C++ and GMP: a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic.
Finding a solution on my pc takes about 1 minute.
